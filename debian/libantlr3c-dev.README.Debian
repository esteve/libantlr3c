libantlr3c for Debian
---------------------

This package contains the development files needed to build parsers generated
by ANTLR v3 in the C language.

The static libraries come in two flavours, libantlr3c_antlrdbg.a and
libantlr3c.a; the former has the ANTLR debugger enabled, the latter has it
disabled (and is the default).
